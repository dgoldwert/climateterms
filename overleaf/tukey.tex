    \subsection{Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) Test}

For both Experiment 1 and 2, we conducted Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test. This test is suitable for pairwise comparisons while controlling for type I error across multiple tests. We found that none of the pairwise comparisons between the terms are statistically significant, as all the adjusted p-values are well above the typical significance level of 0.05 (all p’s > 0.28)
