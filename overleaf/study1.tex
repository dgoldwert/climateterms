The following sections provide the results from our models, calculated using R and directly piped into this document.

\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, condition (one of 9 terms) as the fixed effect, including by-country random effects.}
\input{overleaf/tabs/main} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.
