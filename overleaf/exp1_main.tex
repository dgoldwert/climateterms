The following sections provide the results from our models, calculated using R and directly piped into this document.

    \subsection{All 63 Countries}


\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, condition (one of 9 terms) as the fixed effect, including by-country random effects.}
\input{overleaf/tabs/main} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.

\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, condition (one of 9 terms) as it interacts with political ideology (continuous variable) as the fixed effects, including by-country random effects.}
\input{overleaf/tabs/main_ide_cont} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.

\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, condition (one of 9 terms) as it interacts with political ideology (median split within each country) as the fixed effects, including by-country random effects.}
\input{overleaf/tabs/main_ide_ms} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.

\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, condition (one of 9 terms) as it interacts with socioeconomic status (SES) as the fixed effects, including by-country random effects.}
\input{overleaf/tabs/main_SES} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.

\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, condition (one of 9 terms) as it interacts with gender as the fixed effects, including by-country random effects.}
\input{overleaf/tabs/main_gender} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.

\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, condition (one of 9 terms) as it interacts with age as the fixed effects, including by-country random effects.}
\input{overleaf/tabs/main_age} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.

\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, condition (one of 9 terms) as it interacts with education level as the fixed effects, including by-country random effects. }
\input{overleaf/tabs/main_edu} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.
