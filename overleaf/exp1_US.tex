\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Results for a United States sample. Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, condition (one of 9 terms) as the fixed effect, including by-country random effects. }

\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.
