\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, and condition (one of 10 terms) as the fixed effect.}
\input{overleaf/tabs2/main} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.

\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, and condition (one of 10 terms) as it interacts with political ideology (continuous variable) as the fixed effects.}
\input{overleaf/tabs2/main_ide_cont} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.

\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, and condition (one of 10 terms) as it interacts with socioeconomic status (SES) as the fixed effects.}
\input{overleaf/tabs2/main_SES} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.

\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.
