\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Results for a “core Anglosphere” (US, UK, Canada, Australia, \& New Zealand) sample. Coefficients of a linear mixed effects model with willingness to engage in climate action as the dependent variable, condition (one of 9 terms) as the fixed effect, including by-country random effects.}
\input{overleaf/tabs_Anglo/main} 
\end{table}
\textit{Note.} We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, thereby using 0.006 as the threshold for statistical significance.
